    		 		Whatever few readers I have had probably notice at this point how little I update this website. I would like to move over to WordPress or some other blog hosting website
    		 		and then apply this cool newspaper theme there. More things to come soon! I haven't given up on blogging, I would just like to find a more convenient medium :-)

    		 		I have recently gotten into partcipating in game jams. I am excited about this new feature and wanted to
    		 		share it with you all. This is one of my projects I have been most proud of. I don't have much time to
    		 		write about it all today, but wanted to make sure I shared my progress on my dev blog since it had been awhile!

    		 		While I have talked a bit about monte carlo methods on here, I have not talked much about web developement or the creation of my websites. The first web dev project I ever created was a google docs app for a group project in my software engineering course at university, and this was only a few months ago. It is fairly common to have a web portfolio to showcase your projects, so that alone is an insentive to create a website. That being said, I had a lot of fun learning web dev skills. Google Apps Scripts is a useful tool, but I would not say its exactly as straightforward as creating a website and hosting it where you please. This past few weeks in creating my blog and  <a href="https://jordansprojects.github.io/">portfolio</a> have been really fun and relaxing. 
    		 		<br><br>
    		 		I have also been working through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design program </a>. I wish I had tried out the programs on there sooner, the environment embedded into the site is convenient. I am looking forward to keep learning from it, and to recieve a certificate! (Even if a certificate is useless, it does feel kind of good to recieve one - and at least this one is for free!)

    		 		<br><br> 
    		 		I hope to share the skils I learn with you all soon!

		The Monte Carlo Simulation utilizes a concept called "The Law of Large Numbers". We see it demonstrated geometrically in this MarbleScience video, demonstrated with a circular bowl and marbles.

In this video John Levine walks through the Monte Carlo Tree Search algrotthm. The worked example and the algorithm explained concisely allows me to better understand the steps I need to take to write my own implementation.

 <div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">No Free Lunch and Explainability</span>
	<span class="headline hl4">2 July 2023: </span></p>
	<div class="article_text">
		My coworker and I had just finshed helping a student with a homework dealing with deleting a key from a B+ tree. I had expressed that I find it interesting how different sources provide different rules for the B+ tree. I typically had not seen this when researching other data structures. My coworker explained to me that the further someone explores into mathematics and computer science, the less standardized concepts become. This was something that rang true to me, but I had wish I could have been warned of earlier. I spent my senior year of college frustrated. I was trying to wrap my end around new ideas but struggling to yield the results that I had felt the effort deserved. Previously in my experience in computer science and mathematics, I had felt that while problems can be challenging, there was a solution and that solution can be understood. In my data structures class, I felt that I could easily find informtation on and understand commonly used data structures and algorithms in CS. I thought that through rigorous effort alone, I could understand what I needed to understand. This would all change when began to take classes like Introduction to Optimization and Introduction to Deep Learning. Concepts became more and more niche, and I realized more and more how little I understand about the world.<br><br>

		I expressed my frustrations to my coworker, specifically that it did not make sense to me that "trial and error" would be considered a primary method when determining how to construct a Deep Learning model. (This was something we were told in class.) To me, this seemed absurd. There are so many variations of a model you could build just going off of optimizers, weight initialization and activation functions alone. It was not until I spoke with a different coworker who confirmed that there is a degree of uncertainty when it comes to solving problems. I still have not reconciled with this yet, but I at least have heard it from multiple people I trust. My coworker mentioned the concept of "No Free Lunch Theorem" in mathematical forklore. In lamens terms (the only terms I can  describe this concept in at this moment in time) is the idea that solutions do not come easy, and that two different approaches may yield similar results when their performance is averaged accross all possible problems. I am still just beginning to learn about this concept, but it appears that it was not written with machine learning in mind, but it is related to it. My coworker has a talent of associating different topics together. We would go onto discuss the Monte Carlo simulation and AlphaZero. <br><br>

		This conversation was highly relevant to my work, as I have been in the process of writing my own Monte Carlo tree search library so that I can reuse it accross differnt projects. I reworked the move generation code for the checker playing agent my group and I created in Intro to Deep Learning, but found that the MCTS process was still far too slow. I figured it was worth implementing my own monte carlo tree search where it utilizes methods to improve performance (such as root parallelization and the <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2013/10/28/optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty-the-ucb1-algorithm/"> UCB1 algorithm</a>). I am still in the process of writing this library, and realized that it is going to take a little time and continious research for me to yield the results I want to yield. This library is constructed so that it can interface with various problem spaces, so long as the end user generates all possible actions from a particular state and can determine the reward value from a given state. <br><br>

		I am working on various projects that I will be discussing on this blog. One of them is Turtle Island. In Turtle Island my project partner and I desire to have a variety of mini-games. I thought it would be fascinating to apply the MCTS to poker playing in a Unity Game. This gives me further motivation to complete the MCTS library - but I plan try out other forms of synthetic intelligence as a placeholder (and for fun!).
